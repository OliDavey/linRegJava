This is a basic console based bivariate linear regression modeller
- It currently takes in csv file input, assuming there is headers to each csv column
- It outputs the regression equation, pearsons correlation coefficiant and R squared value

Future Implementations:
- GUI that displays scatter plot, line of best fit and a residuals plot on a dashboard
- Multivariate linear regression modelling capabilities
- Inference for regression: Residual SD, CI for Slope B1, Sampling dist for reg slope and significance lvl stuff
- ... other stuff
